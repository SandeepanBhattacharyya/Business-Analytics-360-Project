## Company Background

AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding global company, specializes in selling computers and accessories through various channels, including retail, direct sales, and distributors. The company recently faced a setback after opening stores in America based on limited data and intuition rather than comprehensive analysis. Meanwhile, competitors are leveraging extensive analytics teams for data-driven decisions. As a result, AtliQ Hardware is prioritizing the development of its own analytics team to remain competitive.


The project began with a kick-off session where objectives, expectations, and potential risks were discussed. Below are some essential questions raised before starting the dashboard development:

- Key Questions Before Starting the Dashboard
- What is the purpose of this Power BI dashboard?
- How will the success of the project be measured?
- What is the project timeline?
- Are stakeholders expecting previews before the final release?
- What outcomes do stakeholders anticipate from this project?
- What concerns do stakeholders have about the dashboard's development?
- Who will use this dashboard, and for what purposes?
- What are the stakeholders' expectations upon project completion?
- What challenges could arise during the project?
- What resources or data are needed to build the dashboard?
- Do stakeholders have any design or visual input for the dashboard?
- Following the kick-off meeting, the data engineering team provided the necessary datasets for analysis. Letâ€™s explore them.

### Understanding the Dataset

A thorough understanding of the available data is crucial before beginning any analysis. This project involved both dimension and fact tables:

Dimension Tables: Contain static data like customer and product details.
Fact Tables: Contain transactional data.

gdb041:
dim_customer
- 27 distinct markets (e.g., India, USA, Spain)
- 75 distinct customers across markets
- 2 platform types: Brick & Mortar (physical stores) and E-commerce (online stores like Amazon, Flipkart)
- 3 sales channels: Retailer, Direct, Distributors

dim_market
- 27 distinct markets across 7 sub-zones and 4 regions: APAC, EU, NAN, LATAM

dim_product
- Product divisions: P&A (Peripherals & Accessories), PC (Notebook & Desktop), N&S (Networking & Storage)
- 14 categories (e.g., Internal HDD, Keyboard)
- Multiple variants for each product

fact_forecast_monthly
- Used for forecasting customer demand to improve satisfaction and reduce storage costs
- Denormalized for analytical purposes, with all dates in a month replaced by the start date
- Contains forecast quantities for each customer

fact_sales_monthly
- Similar to the fact_forecast_monthly table but records actual sales quantities instead of forecasts.

gdb056:
- freight_cost: Details of travel and other costs per market, categorized by fiscal year.
- gross_price: Contains product gross prices with corresponding product codes.
- manufacturing_cost: Details of manufacturing costs per product code by year.
- pre_invoice_deductions: Pre-invoice deduction percentages per customer, categorized by year.
- post_invoice_deductions: Details of post-invoice and other deductions.

## Importing Data into Power BI

- As the data is stored in a MySQL database, it was imported into Power BI using the necessary database credentials.

## Data Modeling

- Data modeling is the foundation of any report, directly impacting its performance. In this project, we used the below snowflake schema for data modeling.

### Dashboard Design

Using the mockups provided, the team designed visuals and created necessary measures as the project progressed.

## Home view

The Home View provides buttons for navigating to different sections of the dashboard, including:

- Info View
